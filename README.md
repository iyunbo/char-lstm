# char-lstm
build an character level LSTM for generating some fun text

When I was learning RNN from
https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/blob/master/recurrent-neural-networks/char-rnn, I was so interested 
in the subject of intelligent generator of text. So I decided to build my own engineered version of char-rnn. I reused 
some code from the original char-rnn, but I mostly improve them by adding unit tests, structuring with modules and tuning
the model in order to make this program useful for more use cases.

### Run the program
```
python run.py
```
